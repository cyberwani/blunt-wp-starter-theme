
This folder is used by ACF5 to save JSON files of field groups to speed up site.

I use ACF for just about everything and allowing ACF to create JSON files to 
speed up the site is a good idea. If you don't use ACF or for some reason don't 
want to allow it tu run more efficiently then delete this folder.
