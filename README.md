Blunt WP Starter Theme
======================

My bare-bones, no-frills starter theme. It has all the things that I want and none of the things I want to avoid.

Minimal Standards Complient HTML, everthing that I feel is unessary or combersome has been removed. There is the absolute minimum CSS there can be to meet WP guidelines. It avoids frameworks and css pre-porcessors, why, becuase they slow sites down. Also, trying to keep up with the latest fads in development is like trying to hurd cats; by the time you think you have one figured out it changes direction and most of the rest have disappeared.

It does have some things that I consider required that you won't see elsewhere though. Functions I frequently use; schema.org markup; well laid out areas and files so I can easily find/add/modify what needs changing.

Guiding principle [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), I've stripped out the 95% that I'm never gonna use and kept or added only those things that I know I'm gonna need and use most of the time.

Read through the files, if you like what you see then use it or branche it, if you don't like it I'm sure there's a starter theme out there that is trying to be everything to every developer that will suit your needs.
