  /*
      this file is included in the footer immediately before the wp_footer() tag
      put whatever html and php you need in that location in this file
  
      This is another one of those files that confuses some people.
      It really exists so that I don' clutter up my footer.php files.
      and also so that if I have serveral footer.php files that I can have
      common code that are loaded by all of them.
