	/*
		this file is included in the footer immediately after the wp_footer() tag
		put whatever html and php you need in that location in this file

		This is another one of those files that confuses some people.
		I find it useful to load some things after the wp_footer() function call.
		Things that are added there cannot be modified or messed with by WP.
		
		I also like to use included rather than clutter up my footer.php file.
		Keeping files small makes them easier to understand and figure out what's
		going on.
