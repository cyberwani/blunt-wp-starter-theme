  /*
      this file is included in the head immediately after the wp_head() tag
      put whatever html and php you need in that location in this file
  
      This is another one of those files that confuses some people.
      I find it useful to load some things after the wp_head() function call.
      Things that are added there cannot be modified or messed with by WP.
      
      I also like to use included rather than clutter up my header.php file.
      Keeping files small makes them easier to understand and figure out what's
      going on.
